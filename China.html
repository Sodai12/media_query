            The Longji Terrace nestled in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
            of China. As autumn approaches, the fields begin to ripen, and in
            the morning and evening, the sun would casts a radiant golden hue
            over the landscape. During my gap year, I had the opportunity to
            live in Longji with my family for a short stay. Longji is home to
            several ethnic minority groups of China, and living amidst them gave
            a unique insights into their distinct culinary practices and
            traditions

            Chengdu, my hometown, is often synonymous with two things: its
            world-famous Sichuan cuisine and the adorable giant pandas. But
            beyond these iconic associations, there's a pace and style of living
            in Chengdu that truly sets it apart. In stark contrast to the rapid
            hustle and bustle of cities like New York, Chengdu thrives on a
            leisurely rhythm. Here, it's not unusual for people to take a break
            from their workday to visit a local teahouse, sipping on freshly
            brewed tea and perhaps engaging in a game of mahjong or simply
            indulging in some laid-back conversation. Summers in Chengdu can be
            oppressively hot and humid, but escape is just a short drive away.
            The surrounding mountains not only offer a refreshing retreat from
            the heat but are also home to numerous Daoist temples – serene
            sanctuaries where spiritual seekers have come to practice and
            meditate for centuries.
